# Vargis

This project aims to be an app which will trigger sound files based on NFC tags and QR codes that are scanned. The idea is to combine both technologies (one NFC tag + one QR code at one location) to make it easy for the user to find the trigger. This is thought to be used in a museum, but can probably be applied in many different environments.

Currently we build upon https://github.com/dlazaro66/QRCodeReaderView/ for the QR reading.
